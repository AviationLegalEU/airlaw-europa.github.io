                            <h2>Our sky is European</h2>
                            <p>Spanning from passengers to pilots, and from airports to the skies overhead, the European
                                Union lies at the core of the regulatory framework that governs the aviation sector.
                                The reason for Runway 33 is the firm belief in a fundamental principle : a commitment to
                                adopting a dinstinctly European approach in providing knowledge about both national and
                                European aviation law. This project is inspired by the collaborative efforts of the
                                European Union towards a cohesive air transport policy. This is precisely why, within
                                its primary objectives, this core principle and aspiration influences how Runway33 hopes
                                to provide distinctive insights that can assist an international audience seeking
                                relevant infomration.

                            <h2>Why the name "Runway 33"</h2>
                            <p>From a firm belief in European cooperation in the sector of aviation, Runway 33 is a
                                project
                                that believes in sharing of European knowledge in the aviation sector. </p>
                            <h2>A project driven by passion</h2>
                            <p>As a personal project, Runway 33 is born out of a passion for aviation and the european
                                collaboration governing aviation law. The author who has designed this website on his
                                own freetime hopes that this passion is reflected in its content.</p>

                                <p><i>It was very clear from the onset that two of my passions would lead me to aviation
                                        law : the love for aviation and the love for European law. This passion has lead
                                        me to create this website to provide this unique perpsective.</i>
                                </p>
                                <p><i>As an aviation lawyer at the Bar of Paris, I have witnessed that a lot information
                                        on aviation law is hardly accessible. When you try to find information related
                                        to national laws of Member States, it is still
                                        difficult to find it for an international audience. I created this website
                                        to bring a new light on this sector of law with unique insights from our twenty
                                        seven Member States including my own : France.</i></p>

                                        However, I will always link you to expert lawyers and scholars and articles for
